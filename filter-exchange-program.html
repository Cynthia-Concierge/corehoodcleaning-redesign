            <h2 class="section-title">What is a Restaurant Filter Exchange Program?</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">A filter exchange program is a scheduled service where clean, sanitized grease filters are swapped out for your dirty filters on a regular basis. Instead of cleaning your own filters (which is time-consuming, messy, and often done incorrectly), professional filters are delivered on a schedule that keeps your kitchen fire-safe and compliant with San Diego fire codes.</p>

            <div class="why-layout" style="max-width: 1100px; margin: 3rem auto;">
                <div class="why-text-block">
                    <h3 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 1rem;">Why Grease Filters Are Critical to Fire Safety</h3>
                    <p>Grease filters (also called baffle filters) are the first line of defense in your exhaust system. They're designed to catch grease particles before they enter the ductwork and accumulate as a fire hazard. When filters are saturated with grease, they stop working - allowing grease to bypass the filters and coat your ductwork, plenum, and exhaust fan with highly flammable material.</p>

                    <p><strong>The problem?</strong> Most restaurant staff don't have time to properly clean filters during a busy shift. Even when filters are "cleaned," they're often just rinsed with water (which doesn't remove baked-on grease) or run through a dish machine (which isn't hot enough to dissolve grease). The result: filters that look clean but are still saturated with grease and ineffective at capturing new grease particles.</p>

                    <p><strong>The solution?</strong> A professional filter exchange program. We deliver professionally cleaned filters (soaked in commercial degreaser and pressure washed) on a schedule that matches your cooking volume. Your staff simply swaps out dirty for clean - no scrubbing, no mess, no guesswork.</p>

                    <p><strong>Benefits of Filter Exchange:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="service-checklist" style="margin: 1rem 0 1.5rem;">
                        <li>✓ Reduces fire risk by keeping filters functioning properly</li>
                        <li>✓ Improves exhaust system efficiency (better airflow, lower energy costs)</li>
                        <li>✓ Extends the life of your hood system (less grease = less wear)</li>
                        <li>✓ Keeps your kitchen cleaner (less grease dripping from filters)</li>
                        <li>✓ Ensures compliance with San Diego fire code</li>
                        <li>✓ Saves staff time (no more filter scrubbing)</li>
                        <li>✓ Eliminates the mess of cleaning filters</li>
                        <li>✓ Provides consistent, professional results</li>

                <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 2rem;">The right frequency depends on your cooking volume, fuel type, and equipment. San Diego fire code requires filters to be "maintained in a clean condition" at all times - which means different frequencies for different kitchens:</p>

                <h3 style="color: white; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; text-align: center;">Why DIY Filter Cleaning Doesn't Work</h3>
                <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto 2rem;">Many restaurant owners try to save money by having staff clean filters themselves. Here's why that rarely works:</p>

                        <h4 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">❌ Kitchen Dish Machines Aren't Hot Enough</h4>
                        <p style="margin: 0;">Grease needs water at 180°F+ with strong degreaser to dissolve. Most dish machines top out at 160°F and use mild detergent - not strong enough for baked-on grease.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        <h4 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">❌ Staff Don't Have Time During Service</h4>
                        <p style="margin: 0;">Properly cleaning filters takes 20-30 minutes of scrubbing with degreaser. During a busy shift, filters get a quick rinse at best - leaving them still saturated with grease.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        <h4 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">❌ Manual Scrubbing Misses Hidden Grease</h4>
                        <p style="margin: 0;">Baffle filters have complex internal channels that trap grease. Only professional pressure washing with heated degreaser solution reaches these hidden areas.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        <h4 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">❌ It's Messy, Unpleasant, and Inconsistent</h4>
                        <p style="margin: 0;">Cleaning filters creates grease splatters, drain clogs, and slippery floors. Quality varies by who's doing it and how rushed they are.</p>

                        <h4 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">❌ You Still Need Professional Hood Cleaning</h4>
                        <p style="margin: 0;">Even with perfect filter maintenance, you still need quarterly or monthly full-system hood cleaning. The filter program is an add-on that keeps your system cleaner between professional cleanings.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Filter Exchange Pricing in San Diego</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">Pricing is based on the number of filters in your hood system and your exchange frequency. Most San Diego restaurants have between 4-12 filters.</p>

            <div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 3rem auto;">
                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding: 1.5rem; background: var(--white); border-left: 4px solid var(--primary); border-radius: 8px;">
                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Number of Filters</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Small hoods (food trucks, cafes): 2-4 filters. Standard restaurant hoods: 4-8 filters. Large island hoods or multiple hoods: 10-20+ filters. We measure and count during your free assessment.</p>
                </div>
                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding: 1.5rem; background: var(--white); border-left: 4px solid var(--primary); border-radius: 8px;">
                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Exchange Frequency</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Weekly plans have the lowest per-exchange cost. Bi-weekly and monthly plans cost slightly more per visit since we're handling fewer exchanges annually. The trade-off: lower frequency = lower monthly cost, but slightly higher per-exchange price.</p>
                </div>
                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding: 1.5rem; background: var(--white); border-left: 4px solid var(--primary); border-radius: 8px;">
                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Custom Filter Sizes</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Standard commercial filters (16x16, 16x20, 20x20) have the best pricing. Oversized, custom, or specialty filters may cost more. We'll quote exact pricing during your assessment.</p>
                </div>

                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Delivery & Service Included</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">All plans include scheduled delivery, pickup, professional cleaning, sanitization, damage inspection, and replacement of damaged filters at no extra charge.</p>

                <p style="color: #555; margin-bottom: 2rem;">The only way to get accurate pricing is a free assessment. We'll measure your filters, count how many you have, and provide a firm quote with no surprises.</p>

            <div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 3rem auto;">
                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding: 1.5rem; background: var(--white); border-radius: 8px;">
                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Do I still need hood cleaning if I have a filter exchange program?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Yes. Filter exchange keeps filters clean, but you still need professional hood cleaning to address grease buildup in ductwork, plenum, and exhaust fans. Think of filter exchange as preventative maintenance that extends the time between deep cleanings and reduces fire risk between services. Most customers pair monthly or quarterly hood cleaning with weekly or bi-weekly filter exchange.</p>
                </div>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding: 1.5rem; background: var(--white); border-radius: 8px;">
                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What happens if my filters are damaged or worn out?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">We inspect every filter during cleaning. If we find damage (bent baffles, torn mesh, broken frames), we replace them at no extra charge as part of your program. This ensures you always have functional filters protecting your hood system.</p>
                </div>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding: 1.5rem; background: var(--white); border-radius: 8px;">
                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Can I change my exchange frequency if my business changes?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Absolutely. If your cooking volume increases (seasonal changes, new menu items, busier shifts), we can increase your frequency. If volume decreases, we can adjust down. We're flexible - just give us a call to modify your schedule.</p>

                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What if my filters don't fit standard sizes?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">We handle custom filters all the time. Older hoods, imported equipment, and modified systems often have non-standard sizes. During your assessment, we'll measure your exact filter dimensions and either source custom filters or fabricate them to spec.</p>
                </div>

                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Do you service all of San Diego County?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Yes! We provide filter exchange throughout San Diego County: Downtown, Pacific Beach, La Jolla, North County Coastal, Mission Valley, East County, South Bay, and everywhere in between. If you're in San Diego County, we'll be there.</p>

                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What time do you deliver filters?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">We schedule deliveries to match your needs - early morning before service, late night after close, or during slow periods. Most restaurants prefer morning delivery (6am-9am) so filters are fresh before lunch service.</p>
                </div>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding: 1.5rem; background: var(--white); border-radius: 8px;">
                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Is there a contract or commitment required?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">We don't lock you into long contracts. Most customers stay with us because the service is convenient and reliable, not because they're forced to. If you decide the program isn't working for you, just let us know.</p>
                </div>

                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What if I miss a scheduled exchange?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Life happens - unexpected closures, renovations, holidays. If you need to skip or reschedule, just call us. We'll adjust your schedule and deliver when you're ready. No penalties, no fees.</p>
                </div>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding: 1.5rem; background: var(--white); border-radius: 8px;">
                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How clean are the filters you deliver?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Professionally cleaned and sanitized. Your filters are soaked in industrial degreaser, pressure washed with heated water, dried, and inspected before delivery. They arrive clean, dry, and ready to install - far cleaner than hand-scrubbing or running through a dish machine.</p>
                </div>

                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How do I get started?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Call us at (858) 361-2570 or book online. We'll schedule a free assessment at your convenience. During the visit, we'll measure your filters, count how many you need, assess your cooking volume, and provide a firm price quote. If you approve, we'll deliver your first set of clean filters and you're enrolled in the program.</p>

                <div class="why-text-block">
                    <p>Grease filters are designed to capture grease before it enters your exhaust system. When filters are saturated with grease, they become ineffective - allowing grease to accumulate in your ductwork and creating a serious fire hazard. Regular filter exchanges ensure your filters are always doing their job, protecting your kitchen and keeping you in compliance with fire safety codes. Our program takes the guesswork out of filter maintenance with scheduled service that matches your cooking volume and local fire code requirements.</p>
