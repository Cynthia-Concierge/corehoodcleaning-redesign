            <p class="section-subtitle">Core Hood Cleaning provides comprehensive commercial kitchen exhaust system cleaning throughout Downtown San Diego. We serve restaurants, hotels, bars, and commercial kitchens in Gaslamp Quarter, Little Italy, East Village, Marina District, and all of Downtown SD.</p>

            <div class="why-layout" style="max-width: 1100px; margin: 3rem auto;">

                    <h3 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 1rem;">Downtown San Diego's Most Trusted Hood Cleaning Service</h3>
                    <p>Downtown San Diego's restaurant scene is one of the most competitive in California. From the bustling nightlife of Gaslamp Quarter to the culinary excellence of Little Italy, your kitchen needs to meet the highest fire safety standards while operating at peak efficiency. Core Hood Cleaning has become the go-to hood cleaning service for downtown restaurants because we understand the unique challenges you face.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tight Schedules & Limited Access:</strong> We know downtown restaurants operate on razor-thin margins with back-to-back service. Our team schedules cleanings during your off-hours (late night or early morning) and works efficiently to get you back to full operation quickly. We've cleaned kitchens in high-rise buildings with freight elevator restrictions, narrow alleyways in Little Italy, and busy Gaslamp locations where timing is everything.</p>

                    <p><strong>High-Volume Operations:</strong> Downtown restaurants see more covers per week than most suburban locations. Your hood system works harder, accumulates grease faster, and needs more frequent professional attention. We customize cleaning schedules based on your actual cooking volume and fuel type - not a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: var(--navy); margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem;">Neighborhoods We Serve in Downtown San Diego:</h3>
                    <ul class="service-checklist">
                        <li>✓ <strong>Gaslamp Quarter:</strong> High-volume bars, nightclubs with kitchens, late-night restaurants</li>
                        <li>✓ <strong>Little Italy:</strong> Upscale Italian restaurants, bistros, wine bars with food service</li>
                        <li>✓ <strong>East Village:</strong> Breweries, craft cocktail bars, Petco Park area restaurants</li>
                        <li>✓ <strong>Marina District:</strong> Waterfront restaurants, hotel kitchens, convention center catering</li>
                        <li>✓ <strong>Cortez Hill:</strong> High-rise restaurant spaces, rooftop bars, hotel dining</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3 style="color: var(--navy); margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem;">Downtown San Diego Fire Code Compliance:</h3>
                    <p>San Diego Fire-Rescue Department conducts regular inspections of commercial kitchens throughout downtown. A failed inspection due to grease buildup can mean immediate shutdown until corrected - devastating for a busy restaurant. Our NFPA 96 certified cleaning meets or exceeds all San Diego fire code requirements, and we provide full documentation for your inspection records.</p>

                    <p><strong>Same-Day Emergency Service:</strong> Equipment malfunction? Last-minute health inspection? Fire marshal visit tomorrow? We offer same-day emergency hood cleaning for downtown San Diego restaurants. Call (858) 361-2570 and we'll get a technician to your location within hours.</p>

                <h3 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 1rem;">What Makes Downtown Kitchens Different?</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Downtown San Diego commercial kitchens face unique challenges that suburban locations don't:</p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>Higher Cooking Volume:</strong> Gaslamp and Little Italy restaurants often do 2-3x the covers of suburban locations, meaning faster grease accumulation</li>
                    <li><strong>Older Buildings:</strong> Many downtown kitchens are in historic buildings with aging ductwork that requires specialized cleaning techniques</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Access:</strong> High-rise locations, shared service elevators, narrow streets - downtown logistics require experienced technicians</li>
                    <li><strong>Stricter Enforcement:</strong> Downtown restaurants face more frequent inspections from both health department and fire marshal</li>
                    <li><strong>Tourist-Heavy:</strong> Can't afford to be shut down during peak season - preventive maintenance is critical</li>
                </ul>

                <div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        <h4 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How often should downtown restaurants clean their hoods?</h4>
                        <p>NFPA 96 requires quarterly cleaning for high-volume solid fuel cooking, monthly for high-volume operations, and quarterly for moderate-volume kitchens. Most Gaslamp and Little Italy restaurants need monthly service due to cooking volume.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        <h4 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Do you work around our hours?</h4>
                        <p>Yes - we schedule most downtown cleanings between 11 PM and 6 AM to avoid disrupting your service. We can also coordinate with building management for freight elevator access.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
