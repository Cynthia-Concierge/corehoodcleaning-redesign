We serve 150+ restaurants, breweries, seafood houses, and beachfront kitchens throughout North County's largest coastal city with full-system NFPA 96 certified hood cleaning.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 1rem;">Why Oceanside Restaurants Choose Core Hood Cleaning</h3>
                    <p>Oceanside's unique position as North County's largest coastal city creates a diverse restaurant landscape that demands specialized hood cleaning expertise. With 175,000 residents, Oceanside spans from the iconic Oceanside Pier and Harbor to the Camp Pendleton gates, creating unique challenges: intense salt air exposure from the Pacific Ocean, proximity to military base operations requiring flexible scheduling, tourism-driven seasonal volume spikes during summer months, and a mix of high-end harbor restaurants alongside casual beach cafes and military-friendly dining establishments.</p>

                    <p>Core Hood Cleaning understands Oceanside's distinct restaurant ecosystem. We've been cleaning hoods throughout North County for years, serving everything from fresh seafood restaurants at the harbor to craft breweries on Coast Highway, from casual taco shops serving Camp Pendleton Marines to upscale coastal fine dining. We know the parking challenges along busy PCH, the importance of salt corrosion prevention, and how to work around both tourist season rushes and military operations.</p>

                    <p><strong>What Makes Us Different in Oceanside:</strong></p>

                        <h4 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">🌊 Extreme Salt Air Corrosion</h4>
                        <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;"><strong>The Problem:</strong> Oceanside's direct oceanfront location creates the most aggressive salt air environment in San Diego County. Harbor restaurants and beachfront establishments face accelerated corrosion on exhaust fans, ductwork, hinges, and access panels. Rooftop equipment can corrode to failure in just 2-3 years without proper maintenance.<br><br><strong>Our Solution:</strong> We've developed specialized protocols for Oceanside's coastal environment. Every service includes thorough corrosion inspection, marine-grade lubrication of all moving parts, and detailed recommendations for protective coatings. We catch salt damage early and help extend equipment life by years. For harbor restaurants, we recommend quarterly corrosion assessments even between cleanings.</p>

                        <h4 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">🚗 Harbor & Beach Access Challenges</h4>
                        <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;"><strong>The Problem:</strong> Oceanside Harbor restaurants have extremely limited access roads and zero parking during peak season. Coast Highway locations face constant traffic congestion. Many harbor buildings require specialized rooftop access through tight spaces or over water.<br><br><strong>Our Solution:</strong> We coordinate closely with harbor master regulations and city parking enforcement. Our team arrives during off-peak hours (early morning or late night) to avoid tourist traffic. We're experienced with every type of difficult access in Oceanside—from multi-story harbor buildings to beachfront properties with external access only.</p>

                        <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;"><strong>The Problem:</strong> Restaurants near Camp Pendleton experience unpredictable volume spikes during military graduations, deployments, and base events. Traffic restrictions during base activities can delay service. Military families appreciate veteran-owned or military-friendly businesses.<br><br><strong>Our Solution:</strong> We maintain flexible scheduling to work around major base events. Our team includes veterans who understand military culture and appreciate restaurants serving the Camp Pendleton community. We offer priority scheduling for military-owned restaurants and establishments that support active duty families.</p>

                        <h4 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">📈 Tourism Season Volume Swings</h4>
                        <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;"><strong>The Problem:</strong> Oceanside harbor and beachfront restaurants see 4x normal volume during summer months. Hood systems that need quarterly cleaning in winter can become fire hazards in weeks during peak tourist season. Off-season revenue drops make year-round fixed contracts challenging.<br><br><strong>Our Solution:</strong> We offer seasonal frequency adjustments. Many Oceanside customers switch to monthly service May through September, then quarterly October through April. We track your volume and proactively recommend schedule changes. No long-term contracts required—we adjust as your business demands.</p>

            <h3 style="color: white; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; text-align: center;">Oceanside Fire Code Compliance & Health Inspections</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto 2rem;">Oceanside restaurants fall under Oceanside Fire Department jurisdiction with multiple fire stations serving the city. The San Diego County Health Department conducts frequent inspections, especially in the high-density harbor and downtown dining districts.</p>

            <div style="margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 800px;">
                <h4 style="color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 1rem;">What Oceanside Health Inspectors Check:</h4>
                <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li>Current hood cleaning certificate showing NFPA 96 compliance and proper service intervals</li>
                    <li>Photographic documentation of before/after cleaning (available instantly via your customer portal)</li>
                    <li>Clean baffle filters with no grease saturation or dripping</li>
                    <li>Hood plenum interior free of excessive grease accumulation</li>
                    <li>Full ductwork cleaning with proper access panel maintenance</li>
                    <li>Functional exhaust fan with adequate CFM for cooking equipment</li>
                    <li>Fire suppression system with current inspection certification</li>
                    <li>No evidence of salt corrosion compromising system integrity (critical for coastal locations)</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"><strong>Red Tag Emergencies:</strong> If San Diego County Health Department red-tags your Oceanside kitchen for hood compliance violations, call us immediately at (858) 361-2570. We offer same-day emergency service throughout Oceanside to get you back in operation quickly. We've helped dozens of harbor and beachfront restaurants resolve red tag violations within 24 hours—critical during peak tourist season when every day closed costs thousands.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Insurance & Liability:</strong> Most Oceanside restaurants carry property and liability insurance requiring documented proof of regular hood maintenance. After every service, you'll receive a certificate of performance and complete photo documentation that satisfies insurance requirements. If a kitchen fire occurs and you can't prove regular NFPA 96 maintenance, your claim will likely be denied—potentially bankrupting your business.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Oceanside Fire Department Stations:</strong> Oceanside is protected by multiple fire stations including Station 1 (downtown/harbor), Station 2 (south Oceanside), Station 3 (Fire Mountain area), and others. Response times are quick—which means kitchen fires are contained faster, but also means hood compliance is strictly enforced.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Most Oceanside restaurants pay $350-$850 per service depending on hood size, ductwork length, rooftop access complexity, and salt air corrosion severity. Harbor-front locations sometimes cost more due to difficult access and increased corrosion maintenance needs. The only way to get an accurate quote is a free walkthrough. Call (858) 361-2570 to schedule yours—we'll assess your system and provide upfront pricing with no hidden fees.</p>

                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Do you offer same-day emergency hood cleaning in Oceanside?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Absolutely. If you've been red-tagged by the health department or have an urgent inspection, we offer same-day emergency service throughout Oceanside—from the harbor to Camp Pendleton. Call (858) 361-2570 before noon and we can usually service you that evening. This is critical during summer season when one day closed can cost thousands in lost revenue.</p>

                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How often do Oceanside restaurants need hood cleaning?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">It varies based on cooking volume and equipment. High-volume harbor seafood restaurants with charbroilers typically need monthly cleaning, especially during peak tourist season. Most full-service restaurants need quarterly service. Lower-volume cafes and breakfast-only spots may only need semi-annual cleaning. We'll assess your specific volume during the free walkthrough and recommend the right frequency for NFPA 96 compliance.</p>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding: 1.5rem; background: var(--white); border-radius: 8px;">
                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How does salt air affect our exhaust system?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Significantly. Oceanside's oceanfront location creates the most corrosive environment in North County. Salt air accelerates rust on exhaust fans, hinges, access panels, and ductwork. We've seen rooftop fans completely seized from corrosion in just 2-3 years without proper maintenance. During every service, we inspect for salt damage, apply marine-grade lubricants, and provide recommendations for protective coatings. For harbor restaurants, we strongly recommend quarterly corrosion inspections.</p>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding: 1.5rem; background: var(--white); border-radius: 8px;">
                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Can you work around Camp Pendleton events and military operations?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Yes. We understand that restaurants near Camp Pendleton experience unpredictable volume during graduations, deployments, and base events. We maintain flexible scheduling and can adjust service times around major military operations. Our team includes veterans who respect businesses serving the military community.</p>

                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What if our harbor restaurant has difficult access?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">We've serviced dozens of Oceanside Harbor restaurants—many with extremely challenging access. Whether it's limited parking, tight access roads, rooftop equipment over water, or multi-story buildings, we have the experience and equipment. We coordinate with harbor master regulations and arrive during off-peak hours to minimize disruption. No Oceanside building is too difficult.</p>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding: 1.5rem; background: var(--white); border-radius: 8px;">
                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Do you adjust service frequency for tourism season?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Absolutely. Many Oceanside beachfront and harbor restaurants see 3-4x normal volume during summer tourist season. We recommend switching to monthly service May through September, then quarterly October through April. We track your volume and proactively recommend frequency changes—no long-term contracts required. You only pay for the cleanings you need.</p>

                    <h4 style="color: var(--navy); margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How long does a hood cleaning take in Oceanside?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #555;">Most standard restaurant systems take 2-4 hours to clean properly. Larger harbor restaurant systems or multi-hood setups may take 4-6 hours. Systems with significant salt corrosion may require additional time for thorough treatment. We'll provide an accurate time estimate during your free walkthrough based on your specific system and condition.</p>
